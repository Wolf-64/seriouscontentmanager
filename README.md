# Serious Content Manager
A simple managing tool to download and manage maps and mods for the classic Serious Sam games.

## Features and usage

To get started you will need to set up a few paths to your downloads and game folders. When this is done, you can start downloading maps via the gro repository web view or adding already existing gro files from your disk.

The main feature is a simple list interface with customizable columns and common filtering options.

Right click on any map to either install (copy gro to game directory) or quick play the map. Quick play will install a temporary "mod" with the selected map, so you can just start a new game directly.
You can mark any map as completed by checking the box in the "C" column.
The rating system currently doesn't work but is being worked on.

Additionally it allows browsing and downloading content via web view directly from gro repository.

If a map comes in different languages, you will be prompted to choose from all available languages.
