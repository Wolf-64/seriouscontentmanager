Right click on any map to either install (copy gro to game directory) or quick play the map. Quick play will install a temporary "mod" with the selected map, so you can just start a new game directly.
You can mark any map as completed by checking the box in the "C" column.
The rating system currently doesn't work but is being worked on.

Additionally it allows browsing and downloading content via web view directly from gro repository.
